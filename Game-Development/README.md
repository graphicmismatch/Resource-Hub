# Game Development Resources

### Engines

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
  * Great tooling for 2D, 3D development.
  * Good community and good first-party support.
  * Exports to pretty much any platform you can think of (including web)
  * C# scripting - easy if you are familiar with c-inspired languages (c, cpp, java...)
  * Most any modern indie and AAA titles are made with Unity.
  * Requirements vary, dedicated graphics card recommended, but will work on mid to upper lower tier machines if you are patient enough.
  * THE main engine for XR developement.
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
  * great 2d tooling. 3d tooling is lacking compared to other mainstream engines but is being improved.
  * great community support.
  * Exports to most platforms (console support is a bit iffy)
  * officially supports GDScript (Python like) and c#. Third-Party support is available for a few other languages.
  * Open Source!
  * No jobs (yet)
  * very lightweight. needs a pc that can run atleast 5 chrome tabs (or a flagship smartphone).
  * has XR support
* [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com)
  * Arguably the best 3D developement pipeline in a mainstream engine. 2D support is meh.
  * Made by a game studio that uses their own engine, so battle-tested by default.
  * good community and first-party support
  * Scripting done visually (Blueprints) or through c++.
  * optimization will take concious effort.
  * if you see a modern indie game with mind-bogglingly realistic graphics, its a safe bet to assume it was made in C#.
  * has decent XR support
  * no web builds in later versions
  * Source Available, NOT Open Source.
* [Many Other Options](https://gameenginelist.com/)
* Or go engineless if you are comfortable with programming custom graphics, physics, audio, networking, input management, and UI Systems.
